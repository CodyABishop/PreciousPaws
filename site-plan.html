		<b><p>Intro</b></p>
		<p>Here at the Precious Paws animal rescue, we’re committed to helping all sorts of furred friends find new homes. We have over five years experience now in caring for our rescued friends, and getting them back on the track to happiness. As part of this track, we are a strictly no-kill rescue that operates with the belief that every animal has a chance at a better life with the right home and care.</p>

		<b><p>Info</b></p>
		<p>At Precious Paws, while we’ve cared for many sorts of furred friends, we specialize in care and finding new homes for Cats and Dogs. Many of these animals were abandoned, mistreated, or donated as babies. This leads to a wide range of temperaments, with each animal receiving specialized care to best help them adjust to a more friendly and caring life ahead of them. As part of the adjustment process once they’re brought in, we examine what information we have of their circumstances alongside how they behave, and do our best to help them adjust to a new life. Careful therapy with people, training for lowered aggression over daily activities, and over time we’ve found nearly every animal comes to be as friendly as can be once you’ve understood them. From there, the animals are given ratings based on what they deal with well, and what can still be distressing to them, such as “Separation Anxiety” and “Aggressive while Eating”. These labels serve mainly as a way to understand that, for example, some cats wouldn’t do well in a house with a child that would pick them up; and some dogs wouldn’t handle a child hugging them in their sleep well 
		either. </p>
		
		<b><p>Process</b></p>
		<p>Once you’ve found the perfect companion for your home, the adoption process is simple.Costs are kept to a bare minimum as our rescue is run from donations primarily. While you can choose to donate, it’s by no means a requirement, and the process for adoption as a whole is as quick and painless as can be. Look forward to meeting your perfect furred friend here!</p>

      <h3>Feline Friends</h3>
		<b><p>Medical</b></p>
		<p>Whether you’re an experienced friend of felines, or looking to meet your first feline friend, Precious Paws we’re sure to have just the cat for your home! All our cats have been fixed and have had all necessary medical checkups and shots, so the only hassle for you is deciding which ones you’re bringing home. All of our animals have medical papers, in addition to written details of the conditions they were found in that may help understand any strange temperaments.</p>
		<b><p>Felines</b></p>
		<p>Cats by nature are a more distant kind of companion than dogs, often meeting you on their own terms as you go about your day. However, different cats all have unique behaviors, with some who are affectionate and cuddly rather than distant and judgemental. These kinds of behaviors are loosely categorized into a “Close | Distant” and “Affectionate | Reclusive” scale alongside any notes we include with the specific feline friend you’re meeting. These are designed so you can best match one to your unique family situation, be it a close companion for the kids, or a feline friend who sits quietly in the room while you read.</p>

      <h3>Canine Companions</h3>      
		<b><p>Info</b></p>
		<p>Here at Precious Paws, we care for quite a few canine companions. First they’re nursed to health, all medical requirements such as shots are taken care of as part of their preparation process. In addition, all care for our canines are delivered using the most recent psychological study to minimize any aggression, and the animals are given ratings based on how they deal with situations and people so you can best identify who’s a good fit for your home.</p>
		<b><p>Canines</b></p>
		<p>Dogs are a much more active style of pet than cats, who often need care like walks and play outside. In addition to the “Close | Distant” and “Affectionate | Reclusive” axes we rate cats with, dogs are further rated on “Excitable | Calm”. Some dogs are just so excited for attention they may jump around, and even with training could be a bit risky for small children. Other dogs are happy to let people hug on them, pet and play around without a care in the world. However, as said before, every dog is unique, and further described with individual notes of anything that scares, distresses; or even just makes them happy.</p>
